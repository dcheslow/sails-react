# sails-react
An easy way to include all *.jsx file within the asset/template folder.
This is a try to make it as easy as possible to work with fb react within sails jst workflow.

## Current State
This package is still under construction and isn't available within the npm packages.
Everything you see bellow is a draft as it should be in future!

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install sails-react --save-dev
```

Or register the plugin within the root package.json file in your sails project.
After this update the npm packages with:

```shell
npm install
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('sails-react');
```

*This plugin was designed to work with Grunt 0.4.x. If you're still using grunt v0.3.x it's strongly recommended that [you upgrade](http://gruntjs.com/upgrading-from-0.3-to-0.4), but in case you can't please use [v0.3.1](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jst/tree/grunt-0.3-stable).*
